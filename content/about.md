## Hey there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Dom, nice to meet you!

After graduating in geospatial data science, I decided it's time to shift my focus on the software engineering side of things. I've got a bunch of experience working with PHP, especially the Symfony framework. In my free time I like to explore new tools, technologies and languages - currently the [Deno](https://deno.land/) ecosystem is my jam.

During my career in software engineering I crossed several domains and diverse technical challenges. My focus always lies upon designing and delivering maintainable, future-proof software - all while avoiding to over-engineer. As a servant team player I value and practice candid feedback. My number one driver is curiosity!

Besides writing code I also enjoy scratching vinyl records (turntablism), practicing martial arts and reading a good book.

If you want to get in touch, feel free to contact me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/meaculpadev) or [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dominic-schuld/).

Cheers :)
