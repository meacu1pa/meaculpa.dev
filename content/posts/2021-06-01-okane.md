## About

> Info: This article is still WIP.

Okane is a simple expense tracker, built with privacy in mind. I was curious to try out some technologies I haven't used before. Namely API-Platform, Vue and Heroku. The app itself is based on a PHP backend, with a decoupled Vue.js frontend. As a hosting solution I wen with the free tier of Heroku, which includes a tiny web server and a managed Postgres database. Beside this, I also built my own Hugo theme, for the landing page and static SEO optimized content. Right now, the static part is run by a tiny Typescript server on the edge via Deno Deploy.

## Linear

Opinionated Jira. My favorite project management tool. Cycles. Gitlab/GitHub integration.

## Heroku

Continuous deployments. Postgres database.

## API-Platform

Symfony, PHP
Provides automatic REST-APIs around Doctrine entities.

## Vue

Vuetify simplified scaffolding the UI elements in the app.

## Hugo

Wrote my own Hugo theme for SEO optimized content pages like blog posts, FAQs and more.
