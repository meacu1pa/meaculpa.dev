## About

> Info: This article is still WIP.

Okane is a simple expense tracker, built with privacy in mind. I was curious to try out some technologies I haven't used before. Namely Linear, API-Platform, Vue and Heroku (more on this later). The app itself is based on a PHP backend, with a decoupled Vue.js frontend. As a hosting solution I went with the free tier of Heroku, which includes a tiny web server and a managed Postgres database. Beside this, I also built my own Hugo theme, for the landing page and static SEO optimized content. Hugo is a Static Site Generator (SSG), written in Go. Right now, the static part is served by a tiny Typescript server on edge functions via Deno Deploy. All my deployment steps are fully automated and only need a merge or push on the `main` branch.

## Linear

For my first product built from scratch, I wanted to try out a new tool for project management. You can think of Linear as a opinionated version of Jira, but *way* better. It let's you plan tickets in the form of customizable sprints, the so called "cycles". Linear comes with integrations for Gitlab and GitHub, which made the ticket flow a breeze. I worked with milestones for the initial release and different epics for the many parts of Okane. A few weeks in I learned, what my velocity is developing Okane besides my day job, and it was quite easy to plan the initial release of the MVP.

## Heroku

Continuous deployments. Postgres database.

## API-Platform

Symfony, PHP
Provides automatic REST-APIs around Doctrine entities.

## Vue

Vuetify simplified scaffolding the UI elements in the app.

## Hugo

Wrote my own Hugo theme for SEO optimized content pages like blog posts, FAQs and more.
