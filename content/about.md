## WIP

I'm planning to update this page soon, stay tuned :)

### Hey there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Dom, nice to meet you!

After graduating in geospatial data science, I decided it's time to shift my focus on the software engineering side of things. I've got a bunch of experience working with PHP, especially the Symfony framework.
In my free time I like to explore new tools, technologies and languages.

Besides writing code I also enjoy scratching vinyl records (turntablism), practicing martial arts and reading a good book.

If you want to get in touch, feel free to contact me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/meaculpadev).

Cheers :)
