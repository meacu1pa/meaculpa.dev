Here you can find an unordered, probably incomplete list of little side projects I created over the years.
Feel free to check them out!

## Okane

[Okane](https://okane-lp.deno.dev) is a simple expense tracker I built in the beginning of 2021. I was simply curious to try out some new tools including [API Platform](https://api-platform.com), [Heroku](https://heroku.com) and [Linear](https://linear.app). The app itself is written in PHP and for the static content pages I created a custom [Hugo](https://gohugo.io) theme. It was quite interesting to build, especially designing a product from the ground up.
