## Hey there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Dom, nice to meet you!

I am a full-stack software engineer focused on continuously shipping robust web applications. During my career, I crossed multiple domains and tackled versatile technical challenges. Being a servant team player, I value and practice candid feedback. My number one driver is curiosity.

After graduating from the field of geographic information systems (GIS), I decided it was time to shift my focus to the software engineering side of things. I've got a bunch of experience working with PHP, especially the Symfony framework. In my free time, I like to explore new tools, technologies, and languages - currently, the [Deno](https://deno.land/) ecosystem is my jam.

Besides writing code I also enjoy scratching vinyl records (turntablism), practicing martial arts, and reading a good book.

If you want to get in touch, feel free to contact me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/meaculpadev) or [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dominic-schuld/).

Cheers :)
